<h3>2- Jan 2011 - DoneCal.com international visitors</h3>
<p>Interesting <a href="http://www.peterbe.com/plog/donecal.com-international-visitors">blog on Peterbe.com</a>
about where DoneCal users come from.</p>

<h3>1 Jan 2011 - AM/PM or 24 hour time format</h3>
<p>It is now possible to change if you prefer AM/PM or 24 hour time format for your calendar.</p>

<h3>31 Dec 2010 - Email reminders</h3>
<p>A new feature is available to enter events simply by replying to a regular 
<a href="/emailreminders/">Email reminder</a>.</p>

<h3>19 Dec 2010 - Use a <code>#</code> sign to tag</h3>
<p><a href="http://donecal.com/features/#feature--4cf2567c74a1f829bc000000">Voices have been heard!</a>

<h3>17 Dec 2010 - Three new Help pages</h3>

<h3>15 Dec 2010 - Calendar view of choice remembered in a cookie</h3>
<p>If you change month or change to a week view it used to be that this was encoded in the
current URL as an anchor link. Now it's just stored in a cookie instead so that you 
automatically return to the view you last time.</p>

<h3>2 Dec 2010 - Change of default window for events in API</h3>
<p>Before the API would allow you to send in events that were not all day events with 
and date equal to the start date. <br>
See <a href="/help/API#rules-for-posting">About dates when posting</a> in the API docs.</p>

<h3>28 Nov 2010 - Feature requests page</h3>
<p>Lots of improvements can always be made but it's best if <em>which</em>
features are added is based on what people want the most.<br>
On <a href="/features/">Feature requests</a> logged in users can vote up their most desired feature requests.</p>


<h3>27 Nov 2010 - Resizing events across multiple weeks</h3>
<p>You can now make events longer than one week by dragging and resizing them across
multiple weeks.</p>

<h3>24 Nov 2010 - Logging in with Google account</h3>
<p>You can use your Google account now to both register and to log in. Means you don't
have to remember which email address or what password you chose for DoneCal.</p>
