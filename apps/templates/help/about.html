<h1>About</h1>

<p>Kwissle was written and maintained by <a href="http://www.peterbe.com" class="yellow">Peter Bengtsson</a>
</p>

<p>It's goal is to have lots of people playing, having fun and learning something. 
To make that possible, the site needs to employ some clever game metrics to make
it worthwhile to come back and play more. Also, for lots of people to be able to 
play a lot we need lots of questions. <span class="yellow">All questions are crowd source</span>, i.e.
<a href="/help/a-good-question">by you</a>.
</p>

<p><span class="yellow">Anybody can <a href="{{ reverse_url('add_question') }}">add a question</a></span> 
and everybody
is encouraged to <a href="{{ reverse_url('review_random') }}">review other peoples questions</a>
so that ultimately your contributed questions can be published by the administrator. <br>
More info about the <a href="/help/question-workflow">question workflow available here</a>.
