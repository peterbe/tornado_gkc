<h3>About</h3>

<p>Kwissle is one of the first real-time general knowledge quiz games of its kind on the web. It uses bleeding edge technology to pit your wits against real opponents in a contest of knowledge and speed.</p>

<p>Our goal is to have lots of people playing, having fun and learning something. 
To make that possible, the site needs to employ some clever game metrics to make
it worthwhile to come back and play more. Also, for lots of people to be able to 
play a lot we need lots of questions. All questions are crowd source, i.e.
<a href="/help/a-good-question">by you</a>.
</p>

<p>Anybody can <a href="{{ reverse_url('add_question') }}">add a question</a> 
and everybody
is encouraged to <a href="{{ reverse_url('review_random') }}">review other peoples questions</a>
so that ultimately your contributed questions can be published by the administrator. <br>
More info about the <a href="/help/question-workflow">question workflow available here</a>.
