<h1>Internet Explorer</h1>

<p>DoneCal is built specifically to use the latest web techniques and some of these are not 
supported on Internet Explorer. Especially older versions that are sadly still quite popular.</p>

<p>Nothing is done deliberately to make it <em>not</em> work in Internet Explorer but there are
no intentions to fix potential problems in DoneCal just to make it work with 
Internet Explorer's idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>If you are unfortunate enough to be stuck with an old version of Internet Explorer your
options are either to upgrade to the latest version or, better, change to a free and secure browser
such as <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> or <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a>.</p>
