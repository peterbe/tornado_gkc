<h1>DoneCal vs. Google Calendar</h1>


<p>Personally, I use DoneCal to track what I <strong>have done</strong> (e.g. hours spent on a support job)
and Google Calendar to track what I <strong>will do</strong> (e.g. meeting at Cafe 10.30am next Tuesday).</p>

<p>When you realise that DoneCal is a database of event entries with a calendar as the user interface it
becomes more clear what the distinction is.</p>


<div id="google-features">
<h2>Google Calendar</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A calendar with lots of powerful features</li>
  <li>Ability to see shared calendars</li>
  <li>Ability to import calendars from other web services (i.e. CalDAV)</li>
  <li>Great reminders (email, SMS, popups) for when events are about to happen</li>
  <li>Interfaces and syncs with various mobile devices</li>
  <li>A powerful but complex API</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="donecal-features">
<h2>DoneCal</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ability to tag entered events easily</li>
  <li>A simple and powerful calendar interface for entering and editing events</li>
  <li>Reporting capabilites per month, per week or per day</li>
  <li>Excel and CSV export functions</li>
  <li>A super simple API for programmatically entering events</li>
  <li>A <a href="/help/Bookmarklet">bookmarklet</a> for quickly entering events in the browser</li>
</ul>
</div>
